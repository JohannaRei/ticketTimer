# ticketTimer

A minimalist app to help track any tasks. Add up to 6 simultaneous tasks and see statistics for your time usage (eventually).
Uses React Native, React Native Navigation, Redux, TypeScript and Firebase.

Created as a practice project but also because I'm terrible at time tracking.

## todos

Redux: because AsyncStorage is too easy  
Firebase: because what if I wanna use more than one device  
Victory: because graphs are great

And better styling.
